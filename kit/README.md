# unraid-plugin-kit

The shared build, test and About tab of these Unraid plugins. A plugin repository holds a copy in `kit/`, made by `bin/kit-sync`, so it builds by itself. Nothing on a server depends on this repository or on another plugin: what a plugin needs at run time goes into its package.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `bin/build.sh` | Package, `.txz` checks (root 755, owner 0/0), md5 into the `.plg`, `CHANGELOG.md`, generated About page |
| `bin/lint.sh` | shellcheck, `php -l`, `node --check`, page headers, the `.plg`'s inline blocks |
| `bin/check-public.sh` | Readiness for a public push: private names, identity, tracked tooling, required files |
| `bin/kit-sync` | Copies the kit into a plugin repository and records the commit in `kit/KIT-VERSION` |
| `bin/changes-from-plg.sh` | The `.plg`'s `<CHANGES>` as plain text, the one source of the release notes |
| `runtime/` | Goes into the package: About tab, install message, changes parser |
| `runtime/drivemap/` | Goes into the package: the drive map library (`DriveMap.php`), its endpoint, and the Drives tab when `DRIVEMAP=yes` |
| `runtime/drivemap/Enclosure.php`, `enclosures/` | Goes into the package: enclosure profiles (which bay a drive sits in, from its PCI path and port; the card's PCIe links; the confirmed cabling) and the library that reads them |
| `runtime/drivemap/DriveState.php`, `Locate.php`, `EnclosureView.php` | Goes into the package: each drive's state as Unraid last read it (no drive is woken), Locate (a read-only O_DIRECT read that flashes a drive's light), and the data of the Enclosures tab |
| `runtime/drivemap/enclosures.*`, `badges.page.in`, `enclosure-badges.js` | Goes into the package when `ENCLOSURES=yes`: the Enclosures tab (front view, bays, Locate, cabling, links) and bay labels on the Main page |
| `render/` | Pages rendered with Unraid's real stylesheets in headless Chrome, on a workstation; made-up servers for them (`drivemap-fixture.php`, `enclosure-fixture.php`, `enclosure-state-fixture.php`) |
| `tests/kit-test.sh` | Builds a throwaway plugin and checks the result |
| `docs/STANDARD.md` | What a plugin of this family has to do |

A plugin needs `plugin.conf`, `<name>.plg`, `src/`, and a `build.sh` that runs `kit/bin/build.sh`.

The copy in a plugin's `kit/` holds everything that goes into its package, and the tools that build it, so a plugin repository is complete source by itself.
